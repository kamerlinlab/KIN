"""
Script to extract and download all unique class A beta lactamase structures
from the database available at: http://www.bldb.eu/S-BLDB.php

The script removes non-natural structures and for enzymes with multiple
duplicates, the structure with the lowest resolution value is kept.
Note: Highest/best resolution structure is one with lowest resolution value.

Each pdb file is then downloaded from the protein databank and stored
inside a folder named: "pdb_files"
