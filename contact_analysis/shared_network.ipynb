We have previously generated contacts based on each frame of a trunkated MD-trajectory for each prtein structure in the family (simulation_contacts). Here we will convert them into a shared interaction network and obtain an network of interactions that are preserved in the family but are lacking in the protein of choice, missing interaction network. Protein of choice used for both projections is TEM-1 (PDB 1M40). "

Steps for MSA with modeller are described in the comparative_data/msa_scores. We will make a set of contacts from crystal structure and 2 sets of contacts from MD a varying MD cutoff (cutoff 10 and cutoff 50).

It is good to select a protein that, in your opinion, is a good representative of the family or a protein of a particular interest. There are 2 methods implemented to calculate conservation score of a contact: method 1 (**conservation_uniform==True**) disregards whether the ranked contacts are present in the structure of interest and evaluates all contacts based on their abundance in the family; method 2 (**conservation_uniform==False**) does not penalize the contact conservation score if the contact was not able to form due to the absence of the residues in the structure.
