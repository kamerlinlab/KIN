    "In this notebook we provide an example of KIN application to the set of MD trajectories and crystal structures. We have previously generated contacts based on each frame of a trunkated MD-trajectory for each prtein structure in the family (simulation_contacts). Here we will convert them into a shared interaction network and obtain an network of interactions that are preserved in the family but are lacking in the protein of choice, missing interaction network. Protein of choice used for both projections is TEM-1 (PDB 1M40). "

It is good to select a protein that, in your opinion, is a good representative of the family or a protein of a particular interest. There are 2 methods implemented to calculate conservation score of a contact: method 1 (**conservation_uniform==True**) disregards whether the ranked contacts are present in the structure of interest and evaluates all contacts based on their abundance in the family; method 2 (**conservation_uniform==False**) does not penalize the contact conservation score if the contact was not able to form due to the absence of the residues in the structure. These methods shown to be quite equivalent in structurally homogeneous families but the second method can be more beneficial for the protein groups with high structural variation. \n",
