This folder contains examples for obtaining contacts from crystal structures and MD trajectories and forming shared or missing interaction networks. We also provide examples of scripts that help to compare interaction networks obtained from MD and crystal structure. 

### Directories:
 **Crystal_contacts:**  contacts from crystal structures of $\beta$-lactamases obtained using single_frame_analysis.py . 
**Simulation_contacts:** contacts from MD trajectories of $\beta$-lactamases obtained using multi_frame_amalysis.py. This can take some time so we recommend submitting this job to a cluster. 
**Static_contacts_processing:** shared and missing interaction networks from crystal structure contacts.
**Dynamic_contacts_processing:** shared and missing interaction network from MD trajectories.
